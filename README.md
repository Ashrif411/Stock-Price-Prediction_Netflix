In this project, I compared the performance of statistical method ARIMA and deep learning method LSTM in the case of Stock Price Prediction Task, with sliding window evaluation. I experimented with two datasets which are: "Netflix Stock Price Prediction" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/netflix-stock-price-prediction) & "Time Series Forecasting with Yahoo Stock Price" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/time-series-forecasting-with-yahoo-stock-price). Experiment on each dataset is done in separate notebooks.
